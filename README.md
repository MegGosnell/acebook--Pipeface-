# AceBook - Pipeface

Welcome to Pipeface! A web styled facebook clone that we developed through weeks 8-9 of Makers Academy. 
We worked in two day sprints for a two week period using Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Bootstrap, CSS, CircleCI and Heroku. As a group we decided on the name Pipeface and used this as a continuous theme throughout our project. The project centered around implementing the CRUD functionality. 

We used Trello to plan our sprints and tasks and used GitHub issues to track issues and resolve them accordingly.
